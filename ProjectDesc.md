## Project Title:

JavaScript Steganography Tool with User Interface

## Project Description:

The project is aimed at creating a secure tool for exchanging confidential information over the internet using steganography. The tool is implemented using JavaScript and has a user-friendly interface for easy use. Steganography is the practice of hiding secret information within an image file in such a way that the presence of the secret information is not noticeable. The user can upload an image, enter the message to be hidden, and the tool will encode the message within the image. The recipient of the message can then extract the hidden message by using the tool.

## Key Features:

-   User-friendly interface for easy use
-   Support for encoding and decoding messages within an image
-   Secure implementation of steganography using JavaScript
-   The tool is accessible from any device with a web browser

The project provides a secure and convenient way to exchange confidential information over the internet. The tool has been thoroughly tested and optimized to ensure smooth operation and user satisfaction.
